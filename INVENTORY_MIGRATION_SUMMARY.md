## AJAX Integration Details

### Changes Made to AJAX Controller
The AJAX controller was enhanced with inventory integration while preserving all existing functionality:

```php
/*
 * INVENTORY INTEGRATION UPDATE - MIGRATED FROM POS2
 * 
 * Why the change is needed:
 * - To maintain accurate inventory levels when products are sold
 * - To provide audit trail for stock movements
 * - To support inventory management features
 * 
 * What the old behavior was:
 * - Only updated product view count
 * - No inventory tracking during sales
 * - No stock movement logging
 * 
 * How the new behavior supports product display in the Home tab:
 * - Ensures inventory levels are accurate for stock checking
 * - Provides data for low stock alerts
 * - Maintains data integrity for inventory reports
 */
```

### Preserved Functionality
- ✅ Product search and display on Home tab
- ✅ Product discount calculation and display
- ✅ Cart functionality
- ✅ Checkout process
- ✅ Receipt generation

## Navigation and Access

### Inventory Access
