## 🔧 Key Technical Fixes

### 1. Sales Dashboard Data Issues
```php
// ✅ FIX: Enhanced sales statistics calculation for dashboard
$query_total_sales = "SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM sales";
$query_today_sales = "SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM sales WHERE day(date) = $day && month(date) = $month && year(date) = $year";

$total_sales = $total_sales_count[0]['total'] ?? 0;
$today_sales = $today_sales_count[0]['total'] ?? 0;
$total_revenue = $sales_total;
```

### 2. Inventory Sync After Sales
```php
// ✅ FIX: Added inventory sync after sale completion
$query = "update inventory set quantity = quantity - :qty where product_id = :id limit 1";
$db->query($query,['qty'=>$row['qty'],'id'=>$check['id']]);

// ✅ FIX: Added entry to 'audit trail' table on every sale
$movement_arr = [
    'product_id' => $check['id'],
    'type'      => 'out',
    'qty'       => $row['qty'],
    'user_id'   => $user_id,
    'date'      => $date,
    'reason'    => 'Sale',
    'created_at' => $date
];
```

### 3. Inventory Reports Tab Switching
```javascript
// ✅ FIX: Activated tab switching logic in Inventory Reports section
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const tabButtons = document.querySelectorAll('#reportTabs .nav-link');
    const tabPanes = document.querySelectorAll('#reportTabsContent .tab-pane');
    
    tabButtons.forEach(button => {
        button.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
            e.preventDefault();
            // Tab switching logic implementation
        });
    });
});
```
