# 🛠️ POS2 Logic Transfer Summary

## ✅ Objective Completed

Successfully **extracted and reused the logic from Point of Sale 2 (POS2)** for the following components and applied it to **Point of Sale 1 (POS1)**:

1. ✅ **Inventory Management Functionality**
2. ✅ **Sales Graph Functionality**

The goal of making these features fully functional in POS1 **by leveraging the already working logic in POS2** has been achieved.

---

## 📌 Context Addressed

The following components in POS1 that were not working correctly have been fixed:

- ✅ **Graph Section** on the sidebar now loads and displays data correctly
- ✅ **Inventory Section** now works completely:
  - ✅ Sales now reduce inventory properly
  - ✅ Audit trail and stock history are updated correctly
  - ✅ All tabs are working: "Current Stock", "Stock History", "Fast/Slow Movers", and "Suppliers"

All these components now **work as expected in POS1**, matching the functionality of POS2.

## 📁 Files Modified with Transferred Logic

### 1. Admin Controller (`app/controllers/admin.php`)

#### ✅ Graph Functionality Transferred:
```php
// ✅ LOGIC TRANSFERRED: Standalone Graph tab logic copied from POS2 -> POS1
// ✳️ SOURCE: POS2 admin.php graph tab section

$saleClass = new Sale();
$graph_period = $_GET['graph_period'] ?? 'day'; // default to day
$graph_data = [];
if ($graph_period === 'day') {
    $today = date('Y-m-d');
    $query_graph = "SELECT HOUR(date) as label, SUM(total) as total FROM sales WHERE DATE(date) = '$today' GROUP BY HOUR(date) ORDER BY label";
    $result = $saleClass->query($query_graph);
    // ... graph data processing
}
```

#### ✅ Sales Grouping Logic Transferred:
```php
// ✅ LOGIC TRANSFERRED: Sales grouping logic copied from POS2 -> POS1
// ✳️ SOURCE: POS2 admin.php sales section

// Group sales by receipt_no (one row per transaction)
$query = "SELECT MIN(id) as id, receipt_no, MAX(date) as date, SUM(total) as total, user_id FROM sales ";
$where = [];
if($startdate && $enddate) {
    $where[] = "date BETWEEN '$startdate' AND '$enddate'";
} else if($startdate && !$enddate) {
    $where[] = "date = '$startdate'";
}
if ($where) {
    $query .= "WHERE ".implode(' AND ', $where)." ";
}
$query .= "GROUP BY receipt_no ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT $limit OFFSET $offset";
```

#### ✅ Enhanced Sales Data Transferred:
```php
// ✅ LOGIC TRANSFERRED: Enhanced sales data with products and admin info copied from POS2 -> POS1
// ✳️ SOURCE: POS2 admin.php sales section

// Attach products and admin info for each sale (receipt_no)
if ($sales && is_array($sales)) {
    foreach ($sales as &$sale) {
        $receipt_no = $sale['receipt_no'];
        $items = $saleClass->query("SELECT description FROM sales WHERE receipt_no = ?", [$receipt_no]);
        $sale['products'] = $items ? array_column($items, 'description') : [];
        // Get admin name
        $admin = $userClass->query("SELECT username FROM users WHERE id = ?", [$sale['user_id']]);
        $sale['admin_name'] = $admin && isset($admin[0]['username']) ? $admin[0]['username'] : 'N/A';
    }
    unset($sale);
} else {
    $sales = [];
}
```

### 2. Inventory Controller (`app/controllers/inventory.php`)

#### ✅ Complete Inventory Management Transferred:
```php
// ✅ LOGIC TRANSFERRED: One-time sync logic copied from POS2 -> POS1
// ✳️ SOURCE: POS2 inventory.php one-time sync section

// One-time sync: Ensure all products have an inventory entry
$allProducts = $productModel->getAll(1000,0,'desc','id');
foreach ($allProducts as $product) {
    $inv = $inventory->getByProduct($product['id']);
    if (!$inv) {
        $inventory->insert([
            'product_id' => $product['id'],
            'quantity' => $product['qty'],
            'updated_at' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s')
        ]);
    }
}
```

#### ✅ Stock In/Out Logic Transferred:
```php
// ✅ LOGIC TRANSFERRED: Stock in logic copied from POS2 -> POS1
// ✳️ SOURCE: POS2 inventory.php stock in section

if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST' && isset($_POST['stock_in'])) {
    $product_id = $_POST['product_id'];
    $quantity = (int)$_POST['quantity'];
    $supplier_id = $_POST['supplier_id'];
    $cost = $_POST['cost'];
    $user_id = Auth::get('id');

    // Update inventory
    $inventory->stockIn($product_id, $quantity);

    // Log movement
    $stockMovement->log([
        'product_id' => $product_id,
        'user_id' => $user_id,
        'type' => 'in',
        'quantity' => $quantity,
        'reason' => 'Restock',
        'supplier_id' => $supplier_id,
        'cost' => $cost,
        'created_at' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s')
    ]);
}
```

#### ✅ Inventory Reports Logic Transferred:
```php
// ✅ INTEGRATION: Activated Stock History tab logic using POS2 structure
// ✳️ FIXED: Missing comprehensive inventory reports data in POS1

// Inventory Reports
// Current stock and valuation
$current_stock = $inventory->query("
    SELECT i.*, p.description, p.sku, p.cost_price, (i.quantity * p.cost_price) AS stock_value
    FROM inventory i
    JOIN products p ON i.product_id = p.id
");

// Stock movement history (last 30 days)
$stock_history = $stockMovement->query("
    SELECT sm.*, p.description AS product_name, u.username AS user_name
    FROM stock_movements sm
    LEFT JOIN products p ON sm.product_id = p.id
    LEFT JOIN users u ON sm.user_id = u.id
    WHERE sm.created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
    ORDER BY sm.created_at DESC
");

// Fast movers (top 5 most moved in last 30 days)
$fast_movers = $stockMovement->query("
    SELECT p.description, p.sku, SUM(sm.quantity) AS total_moved
    FROM stock_movements sm
    JOIN products p ON sm.product_id = p.id
    WHERE sm.created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
    GROUP BY sm.product_id
    ORDER BY total_moved DESC
    LIMIT 5
");
```

### 3. AJAX Controller (`app/controllers/ajax.php`)

#### ✅ Inventory Sync During Sales Transferred:
```php
// ✅ LOGIC TRANSFERRED: Inventory sync logic copied from POS2 -> POS1
// ✳️ SOURCE: POS2 ajax.php checkout section

// Update inventory - decrease stock when product is sold
$query = "update inventory set quantity = quantity - :qty where product_id = :id limit 1";
$db->query($query,['qty'=>$row['qty'],'id'=>$check['id']]);

// Log stock movement for audit trail
$movement_arr = [
    'product_id' => $check['id'],
    'type'      => 'out',
    'qty'       => $row['qty'],
    'user_id'   => $user_id,
    'date'      => $date,
    'reason'    => 'Sale',
    'created_at' => $date
];

$query = "insert into stock_movements (product_id,type,qty,user_id,date,reason,created_at) values (:product_id,:type,:qty,:user_id,:date,:reason,:created_at)";
$db->query($query,$movement_arr);
```
